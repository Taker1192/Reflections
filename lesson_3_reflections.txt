When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when there is a need to share ones work with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might have files that aren't ready to be shared on GitHub.
